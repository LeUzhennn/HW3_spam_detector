# Change Proposal: Enhance User Experience with Dynamic and Interactive UI

**Change ID:** `001-dynamic-ui-improvements`

## Description

This proposal aims to enhance the user experience of the Streamlit application by introducing more dynamic and interactive elements. The current interface is static and provides limited feedback to the user. By adding visual cues, interactive components, and improving the layout, we can make the application more engaging and user-friendly.

## Proposed Capabilities

### 1. Add Loading Spinner for Predictions

- **Description:** Display a spinner or loading indicator while the model is processing the input text. This will provide immediate feedback to the user that their request is being processed.
- **Benefit:** Improves perceived performance and prevents user confusion.

### 2. Visualize Prediction Probability

- **Description:** Instead of just showing the percentage in text, use a visual element like a progress bar (`st.progress`) or a metric with a color indicator to represent the spam probability.
- **Benefit:** Makes the prediction result more intuitive and easier to understand at a glance.

### 3. Provide Example Inputs

- **Description:** Add a dropdown menu (`st.selectbox`) with a selection of pre-defined example messages (both spam and ham). When a user selects an example, it will populate the text area, allowing for quick testing of the model.
- **Benefit:** Lowers the barrier to entry for users who may not have a message ready to test.

### 4. Improve UI Layout and Styling

- **Description:** Refine the application's layout for better readability and flow. This could involve using `st.columns` to structure content side-by-side and adding more descriptive headers or captions.
- **Benefit:** Creates a more polished and professional look and feel.
